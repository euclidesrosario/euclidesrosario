## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Euclides RosÃ¡rio de Azevedo, 
I am a Java programmer with 5 years of experience,
4 of them working with Spring Boot. Also 2 years of experience in
frontend development with Angular.
I studied information systems and network administration at Universidade SÃ£o Tomas de
Mozambique, having completed up to the eighth semester of the course. My professional experience
includes participation in the development of the Bank Supervision Application (BSA) system for the
Banco de MoÃ§ambique at DotCom. I am currently at CBE Southern Africa, Lda, where
I develop internal systems.
I am also co-founder of the Khuma project, a lost and found system. Our
The objective was to collect lost documents in police stations, hospitals, schools and banks,
register them on the platform, and allow people to search for their documents. Case
If they did not find it, they could record their data for future searches.
My diverse experience in backend and frontend development, combined with
My ability to work on innovative and impactful projects makes me a
qualified candidate to join your team. I'm excited about the possibility
to contribute to the company and I am available to discuss how my skills and
experiences can be valuable to your team.
